<p align="center">Configuration files for Funtoo Linux with KDE4 Dekstop (with transition libraries to KDE5).<br>

 - NVIDIA Graphic Card <br>
- Asus Xonar D2 Sound Card (alsa, pulseaudio, 5.1 sound)<br>
- R.A.T.9 Mouse (full buttons configuration (3 in 1 troublemaker buttons off))<br>
<br><br>

This is working desktop configuration, but consider it as a work in progress ~ish.<br>
Make.conf is build to cover as much codecs and hardware compatibility as possible without compromising system speed and security.</p>
